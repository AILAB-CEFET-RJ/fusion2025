# Fusion2025: Data Fusion for Precipitation Nowcasting in a Spatiotemporal Context

In this repository we employ data fusion techniques to propose an algorithm that integrates pluviometric data from surface stations with observations from the ERA5 reanalysis model, incorporating data from the Sirenes, INMET, and AlertaRio station networks. 


## Requirements

Mainly, our code uses Python 3.6. See [config/environment.yml](Link para o env) for other requirements.

To generate the environment for the experiment, run the code below:

```
./setup.sh
```

## Datasets

All datasets are publicly available at http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3558773 (Substituir pelo Link verdadeiro ap√≥s publicar Zenodo). Datasets must be placed in the [data](Like para pasta data) folder.

Note: The downloaded files must be decompressed into the specified folder.

## Experiments

Jupyter notebooks for the first sequence-to-sequence task (given the previous 5 grids, predict the next 5 grids) can be found in the [notebooks](https://github.com/MLRG-CEFET-RJ/stconvs2s/tree/master/notebooks) folder (see Table 1 and 3 in the paper).


Final experiments (see Table 2 in the paper) compare STConvS2S (our architecture) with deep learning state-of-the-art architectures and ARIMA models. We evaluate the models in two horizons: 5 and 15-steps ahead. This task is performed using [main.py](https://github.com/MLRG-CEFET-RJ/stconvs2s/blob/master/main.py) (for deep learning models) and [arima.py](https://github.com/MLRG-CEFET-RJ/stconvs2s/blob/master/arima.py) (for ARIMA models). Results can be found in the [output](https://github.com/MLRG-CEFET-RJ/stconvs2s/tree/master/output) folder.


* `/output/full-dataset` (for deep learning models)
	* `/checkpoints`: pre-trained models that allow you to recreate the training configuration (weights, loss, optimizer).
	* `/losses`: training and validation losses. Can be used to recreate the error analysis plot
	* `/plots`:	error analysis plots from training phase
	* `/results`: evaluation phase results with metric value (RMSE and MAE), training time, best epochs and so on.

* `/output/arima` (for ARIMA models)
	

## Usage

First load the conda environment with the installed packages.

```
source activate pytorch
```

Below are examples of how to run each model.

### STConvS2S

We provide two variants of the STConvS2S architecture that satisfy the causal constraint. Each can be executed as follows (complete example of how we performed the exepriments, [here](examples.md))

#### STConvS2S-R (*applies a reverse function in the sequence*)

```
python main.py -i 3 -v 4 -m stconvs2s-r --plot > output/full-dataset/results/cfsr-stconvs2s-rmse-v4.out
```

The above command executes STConvS2S-R (`-m stconvs2s-r`) in 3 iterations (`-i`), indicating the model version (`-v`), allowing the generation of plots in the training phase (`--plot`).

#### STConvS2S-C (*applies causal convolution*)

To run experiments with this architecture, switch to the `-m stconvs2s-c` parameter.


### Additional parameters

* add `--chirps`: change the dataset to rainfall (CHIRPS). Default dataset: temperature (CFSR). 
* add `-s 15`: change the horizon. Default horizon: 5.
* add `-l 3 -d 32 -k 5`: define the number of layers (`l`), filters (`d`) and the kernel size (`-k`).
* add `--email`: send email at the end. To use this functionality, set your email in the file [config/mail_config.ini](https://github.com/MLRG-CEFET-RJ/stconvs2s/blob/master/config/mail_config.ini).
* add `--small-dataset`: have a quick training using a few sample dataset.
